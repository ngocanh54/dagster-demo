# Albums Pipeline - Another YAML-defined pipeline example
# This demonstrates having multiple independent pipelines in the same project
#
# This pipeline:
# 1. Fetches albums and photos from JSONPlaceholder API (parallel)
# 2. Combines them into enriched albums
# 3. Creates album statistics

assets:
  # Fetch albums data
  raw_albums:
    type: api_fetch
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

  # Fetch photos data (runs in parallel with albums)
  raw_photos:
    type: api_fetch
    url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
    description: Fetch photos data from JSONPlaceholder API

  # Combine albums with photo counts
  enriched_albums:
    type: transform
    description: Enrich albums with photo statistics
    depends_on:
      - raw_albums
      - raw_photos

  # Generate album statistics
  album_stats:
    type: transform
    description: Generate statistics by album
    depends_on:
      - enriched_albums
